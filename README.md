# Rnnnumberseries

This project focuses on using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict future values in a numerical sequence. Given an input series of numbers, the model learns the underlying patterns and trends during training and generates predictions for the next number(s) in the sequence. This type of approach is commonly used in time-series forecasting, stock price prediction, and sequence modeling tasks.
